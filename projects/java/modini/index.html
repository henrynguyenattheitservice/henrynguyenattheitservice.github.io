<ul>
<li>Duration ~6-8 months and 4 production releases</li>
<li>1 x Project Manager</li>
<li>1 x System Architect was responsible
<ul>
<li>Document the 4G-&gt;5G and 5G SA requirements and specifications</li>
<li>Provide guidance to Developers and Testers</li>
<li>Interact with Telstra Subject Mater Expert to acquire requirements and specifications and to provide technical support to Telstra</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 x Senior Java Developer was responsible
<ul>
<li>Work with the System Architect and Testers to analyze the requirements and specifications</li>
<li>Study the current solution from the source code and technologies in the Dev, Test and Production. When the DevEnv is set up with remote debug, and yes the project is heading home with the achievement.</li>
<li>Use JIRA to plan features and defects to each sprint</li>
<li>Hourly to daily analyse each feature and defect with the tester</li>
<li>Develop the features with the unit testing</li>
<li>Develop the solution to for each defect with functional, model suport and production support testing</li>
<li>Develop and deploy the sprint releases with the integration testing</li>
<li>Use Bitbucket to build and deploy the releases to the functional tester also to work with the tester for any short cycle functional testing</li>
<li>Use Jenkins to CI/CD build formal releases to the functional and model support testers</li>
<li>Provide third level support and guidance to Model/Production Support Testers and Telstra customers via System Architect and Model/Production Support Tester</li>
<li>Interact with OCS Developers (billing and charging database and application) and Mediator Developers (sending requests and receiving responses to test mobile services) to develop the technical requirements and specifications.</li>

<p>The objectives were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study the legacy technologies and set up the Development Environment using Java 7, JBoss EAP 6.3, JSF 2.1, Groovy, Gradle 2</li>
<li>Study the solution from the code as there have not been documentation</li>
<li>When developing the new features we must ensure the all backward compatibilities for the 3G, 4G and some 4G-&gt;5G using Home Location paradigm and 4G-&gt;5G and 5G SA using CDB paradigm.</li>

<li><a href="">DevEnv Template for JBoss EAP 6.3 StandAlone</a> We use to understand how JBoss is setup and configure for the development.</li>
<li><a href="">DevEnv Template for JBoss EAP 6.3 and 7.x StandAlone with Load Balance DevEnv</a> We develop the concept to guard against the performance issues. We run many standalone instances and depoy F5 LB to schedule session infinity load balance. We find that the approach is simple (KISS) comparing to the recommended JBoss Cluster. The hardware is an Out Of Life HP Blade with many CPU/Thread running Solaris 10 without Zone or Solaris Container.</li>
<li><a href="">DevEnv Template for JBoss EAP 7.x Cluster DevEnv</a> We develop the LB concept based on the Redhat recommendation but we know that Cluster can be complex when one node or more nodes in the Cluster do not operate.</li>
