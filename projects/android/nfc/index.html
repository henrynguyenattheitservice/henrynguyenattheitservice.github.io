<li>Document requirements and specifications</li>
<li>Provide guidance to Firmware Developers and Testers</li>

<li>2 x Senior Firmware Engineer was responsible
<ul>
<li>Developed firmware for the digital meter using CoAP/LwM2M/IPSO</li>
<li>Developed firmware for interface with the android</li>

<li>1 x Senior Software Engineer  was responsible for 3 production releases
<ul>
<li>Set up the Development Environment for NFC using Android Phone with NFC built in and NFC sensor tag</li>
<li>Set up the Development Environment for the Android to interface with the Firmware using <a href="https://github.com/javolution/javolution">Javolution</a> (open source used to format the Java to C/CPP and parse C/CPP to Java)</li>
<li>Set up the Development Environment for the Android to engineer with
<ul>
<li>Internationalisation with Locale support - UI strings, info/warns/error codes and messages are stored to values/strings</li>
<li>Android update to date structure and releases to support latest android (I just finished reworking on the porting the sew-lct application to the latest android structure from v4/v7 to androidx at the time write this article)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The User Interface and Usability was engineered with the knowledge when I worked at the Telecom Research Lab to engineer simple UI and deterministic usability to work on 5-6 inch screen, water/unclean environment and NFC only works with deterministic stable field by tapping

<li>the protocol to support the NFC constraints (short message) and intermittent characteristic and behaviour specifies

<li>single message and multiple messages</li>
<li>checksum</li>
<li>send and acknowledge</li>

</li>
<li>the model to support the data/information to be inter-operated specifies
<ul>
<li>Device model: Hardware/Firmware/Daughter-Board, Battery, Clock, Network</li>
<li>Commission/Provision/Diagnostic/Calibrate state and model</li>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>Release 1: I spent about 8 weeks to develop the application before Covid-19. The most difficult components were:
<ul>
<li>DevEnv01- Javolution to format and parse message that both Android LCT Application and Firmware can work together</li>
<li>DevEnv02- Protocol that both work over constraint transport layer</li>
<li>DevEnv03- User Interface workflow using Tab and Nested Tab concept</li>
<li>DevEnv04- Engineer the Android Application with International/Locale for all string, Info/Warn/Error messages</li>
<li>DevEnv05: Engineer the Android components at 2017-2018 (v4/v7 Design and Android) Android technology milestones. I did quick upgrade few days ago to support the modern Android components (AndroidX - I will upgrade my github after asking Extel Technologies and Client permission to partially publish the content - to be provided the github link)</li>
<li>Application Development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Release 2: I could not remember anything until few days ago
<ul>
<li>Support for other Daughter Boards: Cathodic, Ultrasonic boards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Release 3
<ul>
<li>Support for other Daughter Boards: Pressure board and features
Please this is just a sample of the second production release</li>
